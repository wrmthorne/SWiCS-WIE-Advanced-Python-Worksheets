# SWiCS & WIE Advanced Python Worksheets

These worksheets were made for the final two sessions in a series of 6, led by Sheffield Women in Computer Science and Women in Engineering at the University of Sheffield.

The goal of these sessions was to bring together Python, NumPy and Pandas knowledge, along with other common mathematical libraries, to develop useful systems for data analysis. The first session focusses on an end-to-end use of linear regression and the final session is an introduction to neural networks via a single layer logistic regression network.

The other worksheets can be found in their respective repositories:
