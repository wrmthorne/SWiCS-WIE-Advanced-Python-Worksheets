    "Python is very fast to write code in but compared to other programming languages such as C, it is very very very slow. For performant numerical operations, an external module for Python called [NumPy (Numerical Python)](https://numpy.org/) is used. To make use of external libraries, we need to first download them. To do this, we use [PIP (Package Installer for Python)])(https://pypi.org/project/pip/). PIP makes use of the [Python Package Index](https://pypi.org/) which indexes a massive number of useful libraries for Python, including NumPy. In your command line you can enter the following command:\n",
